Tests
============

To run the basic test suite, navigate to the ``citoolkit`` root directory and run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ make test


To run the full test suite, navigate to the ``citoolkit`` root directory and run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ make test_full

**Note:** The basic test suite is designed to run quickly, while the full test suite tests more extensively. As a result, the full test suite can take *significantly* longer to run than the basic test suite.
